# 🚀 Silas React Sandbox

_Where React nightmares come to life and performance dreams go to die (or get resurrected)_ 🧟‍♂️

## What the heck is this?

Welcome to my personal React torture chamber! This is where I pretend to be a 10x developer by solving problems that I probably created myself. It's a monorepo playground where I collect React paradigms, performance tricks, and real-world scenarios that made me question my life choices during interviews.

**Spoiler alert:** Most of these "real-world" problems are actually just me overengineering a simple TODO list.

## 🎯 The Master Plan

This sandbox is my attempt to:

- ✅ Actually understand React instead of just copy-pasting from Stack Overflow
- ✅ Impress future employers with my "extensive" knowledge
- ✅ Create solutions for problems that probably have npm packages already
- ✅ Procrastinate on real work by calling this "skill development"
- ✅ Convince myself that I'm not just another frontend developer who centers divs for a living

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
silas-react-sandbox/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Frontend (Next.js) - Where the magic doesn't happen
│   └── api/          # Backend (Express) - My attempt at being "full-stack"
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared components - Reinventing the wheel since 2020
│   └── utils/        # "Utility" functions that could be one-liners
└── docs/             # Documentation nobody will read (including me)
```

## 🧪 Current Experiments

### WIP (Work In Progress)

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed. If you don't, stop reading this and go install it. I'll wait.

```bash
# Clone this beautiful mess
git clone https://github.com/silas/silas-react-sandbox.git
cd silas-react-sandbox

# Install dependencies (prepare for npm install anxiety)
npm install

# Start the development servers (fingers crossed)
npm run dev
```

If everything goes according to plan (which it won't):

- Frontend will be at `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend will be at `http://localhost:3001`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- **Next.js 14**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TanStack Query**

**Backend:**

- **Express.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL**

**Tooling:**

- **Turborepo** - Monorepo management for people who like complexity
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Making my code look professional (spoiler: it doesn't help)

_Built with ❤️ and questionable architectural decisions_
